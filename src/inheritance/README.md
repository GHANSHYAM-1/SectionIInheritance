# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

## Motives
1. What is "Inheritance"?
2. How can we use "Inheritance" to re-use code/program(s)/software that are already developed and tested.
3. Observe the use of the `extends` keyword.
4. What is a `super` class and what is `sub` class.
5. How we can access the members of a `superclass` from a `subclass`.
6. Constructor Hierarchy.
7. Method Overriding, Dynamic Method Dispatch, Abstract Classes & Interfaces.
8. How we can model our programs to use all the concepts written above.

### Inheritance

- Simple English: 
-   Inheritance (noun): something that is (already) or may be (in the future) "inherited".
-   Inheritance (verb): the act of "inheriting" some things.

- Real-Life Examples:
1. Hair Color, color of the skin, color of the eyes, height, ... etc. (physical attributes)
- These are "inherited" by YOU from YOUR PARENTS.
2. Some money, a house, a car, some possessions, ... etc. (items of monetary value)
- These might be "inherited" by YOU from YOUR PARENTS, if they choose so.

- Definition: One ENTITY can acquire the properties/attributes/behaviour/traits/possessions
of another ENTITY related to it via Inheritance.

- Object-Oriented:
